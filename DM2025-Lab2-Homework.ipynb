        "\n",
        "What this project demonstrated to me was the importance of using the right similarity metric and feature representation. Early cosine-similarity and linear baselines performed decently but lacked contextual understanding. Transformer architectures drastically improved performance because they capture semantic meaning rather than relying on sparse word counts.\n",
        "\n",
        "Then learning rate and warmup scheduling had a clear impact on stability and macro-F1. Cross validation proved critical: individual folds varied, but averaging across folds improved the Kaggle score by smoothing prediction noise.\n",
